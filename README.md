# Nest-ODR
Uses Raspberry pi to create an Outdoor Reset override module for Nest Thermostats

Modulating/Condensing (mod/con) boilers with Outdoor Reset (ODR) function are among the most energy efficient home heating devices 
available. However, because mod/con boilers operate at lower temperatures than conventional boilers and furnaces, they do not work 
well with advanced programable and learning thermostats (e.g. Nest) that offer energy savings by programming nightly temperature 
setbacks or when homes are not occupied. Mod/con boilers with ODR adjust their heat output to compensate for outdoor temperatures by 
dialing back heat ouput during warm weather and increasing output when it is cold. A properly tuned mod/con ODR boiler will produce 
just enough heat to compensate for the building's heat loss and therefore run at lower output for longer output for longer periods 
of time.

Because of their lower operating temperatures, mod/con ODR boilers can take many hours to recover from a temperature setback, if they
recover at all. Some boiler manufacturers
